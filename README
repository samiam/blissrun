A static website for Bliss Run Mindfulness Community in Columbus, OH.

Development:

Application was written in Rails.  Sinatra would have been fine, but
the hosting company didn't support Rack, everything is fcgi and it was
a pain to get Sinatra working in that environment.  Frankly, rails
wasn't much better with the hosting company.

Application setup:

Install rails on system

Freeze it:
  rake rails:freeze:edge RELEASE=2.3.5

Update it:
  rake rails:unfreeze
  rake rails:freeze:edge RELEASE=2.3.8
  Update config/environment.rb RAILS_GEM_VERSION = '2.3.10'

Install necessary plugins:
  script/plugin -v install git://github.com/nex3/haml.git  -r tags/3.0.18
  script/plugin install git://github.com/ambethia/recaptcha.git

Hosting setup:

Add symlink from public_html to rails/public directory:

~/public_html/blissrun -> ../etc/rails_apps/blissrun/public/

These files MUST be added to the public directory:

644 .htaccess
755 dispatch.cgi
755 dispatch.fcgi
755 dispatch.rb

At this point you should be able to visit web site and see the Rails
environment file.
