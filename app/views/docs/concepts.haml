  %h3#sitting_meditation Sitting Meditation

  "Sit or lie down in a way that allows your body to rest. Sitting, your
  head and spine form a straight line. Relax all your muscles. Find a
  way of sitting that allows you to sit for at least 20 minutes without
  becoming too stiff or tired. As soon as you sit down, pay attention to
  your breath. Then notice your posture, a little bit everywhere. Relax
  the muscles in your face. If you are angry or worried, those muscles
  will be tense. Smile lightly, and you will relax hundreds of muscles
  in your face. Then notice your shoulders, and let go of the tension
  there. Don't try too hard. Just breathe mindfully, and scan your
  whole body."

  %h3#walking_meditation Walking Meditation

  "Walk more slowly than you usually do, but not too slowly, while
  breathing normally. Do not try to control your breathing. Walk along
  this way for a few minutes. Then notice how many steps you take as
  your lungs fill and how many steps you take as they empty. In this
  way, your attention includes both breath and steps. You are mindful of
  both.... Your half-smile brings calmness and delight to your steps and
  your breath.... After a few hours of serious practice, you will find
  that the four of them — the breath, the counting, the steps, and the
  half-smile — blend together in a marvelous balance of
  mindfulness. This is equanimity, created by the practice of walking
  meditation. The four elements of breathing, counting, stepping, and
  the half-smile become one."

  %h3#bell_ringing Bell Ringing

  On your arrival you might hear a bell sound and suddenly people around
  you have stopped still, stopped talking, and stopped moving. It might
  be the telephone ringing or the clock chiming, or the monastery bell
  sounding. These are our bells of mindfulness. When we hear the sound
  of the bell we relax our body and become aware of our breathing. We do
  that naturally, with enjoyment, and without solemnity or being
  stiffed.
  %p
  When we hear one of these mindfulness bells ring, we stop all of our
  conversations and whatever we are doing and bring our awareness to our
  breathing. The ringing bell has called out to us:
  %p
  Listen, listen,
  %br
  this wonderful sound brings me back to
  %br
  my true home.
  %p
  By stopping to breathe and restore our calm and our peace, we become
  free, our work becomes more enjoyable and the friend in front of us
  becomes more real. Back home we can use the ringing of our telephone,
  the local church bells, the cry of a baby, or even the sound of fire
  engines and ambulances as our bells of mindfulness. With just three
  conscious breaths we can release the tensions in our body and mind and
  return to a cool and clear state of being.

  %h3#noble_silence Noble Silence

  A period of deep silence is observed starting from the end of the
  evening sitting meditation until after breakfast the next
  morning. This is very healing. We allow the silence and the calmness
  to penetrate our flesh and bones. We allow the energy of the Sangha
  and its mindfulness to penetrate our body and mind. We go back to our
  tents or dormitories slowly, aware of every step. We breathe deeply
  and enjoy the stillness and the freshness. Let us not talk to the
  person walking by our side; she or he needs our support, too. We can
  stay alone outside with the trees and the stars for about ten minutes,
  then go inside to use the bathroom, to change and go to bed right
  away.
  %p
  Lying on our back, we can practice Deep Relaxation until sleep
  comes. In the morning, we move mindfully and silently, taking time to
  breathe, to go to the bathroom and then proceeding right away to the
  meditation hall. We do not have to wait for anyone. When we see
  someone along the path, we just join our palms and bow, allowing him
  or her to enjoy the morning the way we do.
  %p

  We need everyone to participate for the practice to be deep and
  joyful. This is the practice we do every day, except on lazy nights
  and on festival days like the Full Moon Celebration. Thank you for
  your joyful practice.


  %h3#breathing Breathing

  Our breathing is a stable solid ground that we can take refuge
  in. Regardless of our internal weather- our thoughts, emotions and
  perceptions- our breathing is always with us like a faithful
  friend. Whenever we feel carried away, or sunken in a deep emotion, or
  scattered in worries and projects, we return to our breathing to
  collect and anchor our mind.
  %p

  We feel the flow of air coming in and going out of our nose. We feel
  how light and natural, how calm and peaceful our breathing
  functions. At any time, while we are walking, gardening, or typing, we
  can return to this peaceful source of life.
  %p

  We may like to recite:
  %p
  Breathing in I know that I am breathing in.
  %br
  Breathing out I know that I am breathing out.
  %p

  We do not need to control our breath. Feel the breath as it actually
  is. It may be long or short, deep or shallow. With our awareness it
  will naturally become slower and deeper. Conscious breathing is the
  key to uniting body and mind and bringing the energy of mindfulness
  into each moment of our life.
