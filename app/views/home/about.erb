
About

Everyone who comes to practice is a member of the sangha. Even if we come to Plum Village for only one week, our presence and our practice can contribute to the vitality and harmony of the sangha.

In society, much of our suffering comes from feeling disconnected from one another. We often don’t feel a real connection even with people we live close to, such as our neighbors, our co-workers and even our family members. Each person lives separately, cut off from the support of the community. Being with the Sangha can heal these feelings of isolation and separation. We practice together, share a room together, eat side by side and clean pots together. Just by participating with other practitioners in the daily activities we can experience a tangible feeling of love and acceptance.

Thay often says that the sangha is a garden, full of many varieties of
trees and flowers. When we can look at ourselves and at others as
beautiful, unique flowers and trees we can truly grow to understand
and love one another. One flower may bloom early in the spring and
another flower may bloom in late summer. One tree may bear many fruits
and another tree may offer cool shade. No one plant is greater, or
lesser, or the same as any other plant in the garden. Each member of
the sangha also has unique gifts to offer to the community. We each
have areas that need attention as well. When we can appreciate each
member’s contribution and see our weaknesses as potential for growth
we can learn to live together harmoniously. Our practice is to see
that we are a flower or a tree, and we are the whole garden as well,
all interconnected.
